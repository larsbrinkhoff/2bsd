The directories 2.9BSD and 2.11BSD contain these UNIX distributions, and
were supplied by Steven Schultz. They contain a full distribution, including
installation tape images.

The remaining gzipped tar files are other 2BSD distributions supplied by
Keith Bostic, except for spencer_2bsd.tar.gz which came from Henry Spencer.
They do not contain installation tape images. The 2.9BSD-Patch directory
contains patches to 2.9BSD dated August 85, and again supplied by Keith Bostic.

Note that Steven Schultz is still maintaining 2.11BSD, fixing bugs and making
improvements. The patches required to bring this archive version of 2.11BSD
up to the current patch level can be obtained via anonymous ftp to
ftp://ftp.to.gd-es.com/pub/2.11BSD/

The 2.9-derivatives directory contains a number of 2.9BSD derivaties, mainly
for the Pro/350 and Pro/380 series machines, and to add MSCP support to 2.9BSD.
