This subtree consists of mods. to the 2.9BSD distribution that allow
it to be run on the dec pro 350
- each directory contains the modified files or a diffs.sys file generated
  via. diff that shows the changes required
- boot.doc gives an overview of the bootstrapping exercise
- misc has a few utilities that are modified or required for bootstrapping
  (they should be compiled with the -DGOO option to enable mods.)
- ra.c etc. drive the RQDX1 controller on the Micro/pdp11 and should also
  work on a unibus UDA50
If you have difficulties or bug (fixes??) for any of the stuff, I can be
contacted via.

PS. If you really get stuck on the bootstrapping, I may be willing to
put the binaries on floppies for a copying fee.
