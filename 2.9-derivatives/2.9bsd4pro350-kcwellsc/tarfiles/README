The tar files in this directory contain the contents of the 2.9BSD dumps
from Ken Wellsch's RX50 disk images. Here is what each tar file matches:

	root.tar.gz	matches		box#0/root*.rx50
	2root.tar.gz	matches		box#2/root*.rx50
	usr+k.tar.gz	matches		box#[12]/usr+k*.rx50
	usrN.tar.gz	matches		box#2/usr?.rx50

Also in this directory is the quick C hack, rx50ileave.c, which I wrote
to undo the interleaving on the RX50 disk images.
