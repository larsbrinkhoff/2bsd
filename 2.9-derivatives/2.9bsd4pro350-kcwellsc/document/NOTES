I scanned these (and compressed them) as TIFF [with G4 compression].
That is:

% tiffinfo page01.tif

	page01.tif:
	TIFF Directory at offset 0xdd40
	  Subfile Type: (0 = 0x0)
	  Image Width: 2550 Image Length: 3300
	  Resolution: 300, 300 pixels/inch
	  Bits/Sample: 1
	  Compression Scheme: CCITT Group 4
	  Photometric Interpretation: min-is-white
	  Thresholding: error diffused
	  Samples/Pixel: 1
	  Rows/Strip: 25
	  Planar Configuration: single image plane

As uncompressed TIFF, they are approximately 1Mb each in size.

The files are scans of the 8 pages of documentation provided - the
originals are photo-copies it would seem of hand-written instructions.
